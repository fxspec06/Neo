Neo
A twitter client
===================================================

source is where everything important is
inside there you've got a javascripts folder which holds main app components and utilities and container boxes.
also there's a themes folder, which is the engine for customizing anything or simply displaying any of the six possible themeable elements
lastly there's Neo.js which is the main kind rendered in the index.html page.
